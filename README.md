# The Attention Mechanism

When we read a sentence, article, or book, we give greater attention to certain words over others.  For exmaple, consider the sentence:

"Messi is the greatest footballer of all time."

Likely, you paid more attention to "Messi", "greatest", and "footballer" over "is", "the", and "of".  Attention in computer science operates off of a very similar premise: some words are more important to the meaning of entire sentences than others.  A good attention mechanism can identify important words and ignore others
