Moby Dick

by Herman Melville (1819-1891)


Born in New York City, the son of New England merchant.
He worked at odd jobs (clerk, garmhand, teacher)
before sailing to the South Seas on the whaler _Acushnet_.
He deserted his ship, lived among cannibals, mutinied on
an Australian boat, then spent two years on an American
boat returning to the U.S.  He successfully romanticized
these adventures, publishing seven novels in six years,
including _Moby Dick_ (1851), one of the masterworks of
American fiction.  His popularity waned, and by the time
he died he was virtually forgotten.  _Billy Budd_ was
his last great novel.  As his writing declined, Melville
sailed again, around Cape Horn to San Francisco on a clipper
ship commanded by his brother.
